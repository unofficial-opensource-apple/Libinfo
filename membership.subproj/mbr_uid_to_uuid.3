.Sh NAME
.Nm mbr_uid_to_uuid,
.Nm mbr_gid_to_uuid,
.Nm mbr_uuid_to_id,
.Nm mbr_sid_to_uuid,
.Nm mbr_uuid_to_sid
.Nd user and group identifier translation functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In membership.h
.Ft int
.Fn mbr_uid_to_uuid "uid_t id" "uuid_t uu"
.Ft int
.Fn mbr_gid_to_uuid "gid_t id" "uuid_t uu"
.Ft int
.Fn mbr_uuid_to_id "const uuid_t uu" "uid_t *id" "int *id_type"
.Ft int
.Fn mbr_sid_to_uuid "const nt_sid_t *sid" "uuid_t uu"
.Ft int
.Fn mbr_uuid_to_sid "const uuid_t uu" "nt_sid_t *sid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Users and groups can be referred to in multiple ways.
In addition to the traditional uid and gid, 
every user or group can be referenced by a 128 bit uuid.
Additionally, if the user or group is hosted on a PDC
or Active Directory server, it will have a 128 bit or larger sid.
.Pp
These routines communicate with the
.Xr DirectoryService 8
daemon.
.Pp
.Fn mbr_uid_to_uuid
takes a uid and looks up the associated user account.
It provides the the uuid for that user as an output parameter.
.Pp
.Fn mbr_gid_to_uuid
similarly gets the uuid associated with a group.
.Pp
.Fn mbr_uuid_to_id
takes a uuid that refers to a user or group and fetches the corresponding uid or gid.
.Fa id_type
is set to ID_TYPE_UID or ID_TYPE_GID to indicate which type was found.
Note that
.Fn mbr_uuid_to_id
always returns an id even if the uuid is not found.
This returned id is not persistant, 
but can be used to map back to the uuid during runtime.
To determine if the uuid exists, the returned id can be used in a call to
.Xr getpwuid 3
or
.Xr getgrgid 3 .
.Pp
.Fn mbr_sid_to_uuid
takes a sid and returns the associated uuid.
Like
.Fn mbr_uuid_to_id ,
.Fn mbr_sid_to_uuid
always returns a uuid for the sid, even if the sid can not be found.
.Pp
.Fn mbr_uuid_to_sid
returns a sid for the associated uuid.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return 0 on success, or EIO if communications with the
.Xr DirectoryService 8
daemon fails.
ENOENT is returned if the mapping can not be performed.
